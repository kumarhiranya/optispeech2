# Development Environment

You can clone this project using the [git](https://git-scm.com) version control system. This will also track each person's changes and ease the process of merging changes from different developers. Merging changes in Unity scenes and prefabs is pretty complicated and messy, so its recommended to only edit prefabs for the specific changes being made, whenever possible. When you do need to merge changes in the same scene or prefab, it's recommended to use [Smart Merge](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html).

## Unity Version

2020.01.0b15 (or potentially higher, but make sure all developers are using the same version at all times)

You'll also probably want to use Visual Studio for editing scripts. 

## Documentation

To generate documentation, you'll need to [install docFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html) and make sure its on your system's PATH environment variable ([Windows Guide](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)).
