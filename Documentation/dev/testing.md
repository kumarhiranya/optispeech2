# Testing

This is a big TODO. Unit testing will be super important, and should ideally involve testing each feature with various different profiles, with mocking for each of the different data sources. See [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/getting-started.html) on how to get started with the [Unity Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/index.html).
