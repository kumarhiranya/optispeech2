# WaveFront Data Source

This data source reads data from compatible [NDI Wave System](https://www.ndigital.com/msci/products/vox-ema/) hardware through WaveFront's RealTime API (RTAPI). This requires WaveFront to be running.

If the WaveFront data source is not available, its possible the hardware or network configurations on the computer are different from the default. In that case you can change the host and port OptiSpeech 2 will search for WaveFront's RTAPI in the [Advanced Settings Panel](./advanced.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Some versions of WaveFront may support different features, like starting sweeps on WaveFront at the same time as they're started in OptiSpeech 2
