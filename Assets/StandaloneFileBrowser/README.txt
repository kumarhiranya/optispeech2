This is an asset downloaded from https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser under the MIT license. Additionally it has been slightly modified to remove error messages and crashes as necessary. 

The repository isn't in active development at the time of writing, but we're using it because it is a easy to use wrapper around OS-specific file dialog systems.
